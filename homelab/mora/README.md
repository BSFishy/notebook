# mora

mora is my custom homelab management tool. the idea started as i want to
describe my services using a docker-compose style configuration but deploy it to
k8s because i dont like writing k8s manifests. it has ballooned to also
including a management service and micromanagers for individual services, but it
is what it is. the architecture note goes into that more.

another aspect of it is the language itself. i decided to build its own language
because im a masochist. i really actually just wanna be able to practice my
language development and design stuff
